### **THEME 1: Socio-technical Challenges & Opportunities**

**Focus:** People, systems, ethics, governance, community, labor.  
This theme centers on the *human, political, and institutional layers* behind African data work.

#### **Key Areas to Cover:**

1. **Human Labor & Compensation**  
   * Realities of being a data labeler or annotator in Africa  
   * Payment, working conditions, invisible labor  
   * Local vs global compensation standards  
2. **Community-Driven Data Collection**  
   * Building datasets with/for communities  
   * Who defines what gets collected? Who gets to say how the data is being used? Who gets to benefit? Whose voice is missing?  
   * Examples of community annotation, feedback loops (i.e., bottom-up input, not only top-down instruction)  
3. **Data Governance & Ownership**  
   * Who owns the data? What happens post-collection?  
   * Licensing, consent, power asymmetries  
   * Global tech interests vs data ownership (or community sovereignty?)  
   * Is open source doing more harm than good?  
   * How are data licenses / policies enforced? Is there opportunity for recourse if violations occur?   
4. **Data and Cultural sovereignty**  
   *   
5. **Policy, Funding & Ethics**  
   * What funders do/don’t understand about ground realities  
   * Challenges in getting ethical review or funding for data collection  
   * African policymaker blindspots or missed opportunities  
   * Policy perspectives that balance investment attractiveness / funding for innovation against community benefits and interests  
6. **Tooling & Infrastructure**  
   * Transparency into data collection and annotation processes

#### **Example Talk Titles:**

* “We collect data but don’t own it?”  
* “Labeling 10,000 samples for $40 – the hidden cost of African AI”  
* “From WhatsApp to corpus: How my community built a speech dataset”  
* “Why ethical review boards in Africa are failing AI data workers”  
* “How we navigated data licensing for XYZ corpus”

### **THEME 2: Technical Challenges & Opportunities**

**Focus:** Processes, pipelines, quality, models, tools, data-centric engineering.  
This theme is about the *hands-on, technical realities* of working with African data.

#### **Key Areas to Cover:**

1. **Dataset Measurement & Evaluation**  
   * Why should we measure datasets and what should we measure?  
   * How do we measure coverage, bias, quality?  
   * What makes a good dataset about African Information? What context is necessary?   
   * How do we best record African data?  
   * \*Creative evaluation methods when test sets are lacking   
2. **Data Pipelines & Annotation Processes**  
   * Tools, standards, annotation frameworks used (or built from scratch)  
   * Pipeline innovations for low-resource or multilingual scenarios  
   * QA processes, checks, and what “good enough” looks like  
   * Annotation challenges  
     1. What data annotation software do people use? What are the challenges?   
3. **Open Source Constraints**  
   * Limits of current open datasets or disadvantages of open-source  
   * What’s missing? What are the blind spots?  
4. **Data – Product Pipeline**  
   * How startups turn raw data into usable products  
   * Balancing open-source contributions with monetisation  
5. **Model – Data Fit**
