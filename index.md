title: Centring Data in African AI
---

This workshop examines the challenges and opportunities surrounding data in African AI through both technical and socio-technical lenses. In particular, it highlights the importance of African data—data collected by or about Africans—as a means for local communities to assert greater agency and ownership within the AI value chain. 

By framing data as a foundational resource for AI development, the workshop aims to raise awareness of key concepts such as data licensing, annotation practices, and ethical data stewardship. 

It will also provide a platform to discuss the current landscape of the data pipeline, share openly available datasets and tools, and foster connections among researchers, practitioners, and other stakeholders. A final report will be published to document the insights, resources, and outcomes of the workshop.
